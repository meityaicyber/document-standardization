``standardize_report`` takes a report and returns the JSON that the pipeline
produced for it. That JSON is the output: exactly the structure of
``master_schema.json``, identical to the ``<name>.json`` file written alongside.

It returns whenever a result exists, including when the fallback had to be used
(this is logged as a warning and recorded in the run report). Pass ``strict=True``
to get ``ModelPipelineFailed`` instead, or use ``process_report`` when the caller
needs the run status and report next to the JSON.

The pipeline (and with it the model) is created once per process and reused.
Calls are serialised: one document is processed at a time.
